- I found uncommitted code for [[Dagster]], [[Dagit]], and [[Dagster user code deployment|user code deployment]].
- [[Dagit]] shows only [[Dagster repositories|repositories]] that are defined during the deployment.
	- It is not an issue if there is Dagster deployment for each project.
	- It is an issue if I want to have a single [[Dagster]] and [[Dagit]] deployment and then be able to add new project repository.
- I fixed the issue in a dirty way using template strings in the [[Makefile]]. It needs to rewritten. It might be a nice use case for implementing [[Kubernetes operator]]
