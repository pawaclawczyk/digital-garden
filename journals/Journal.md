Latest months I struggle with organizing my work. This struggle causes terrible ineffectiveness of my time spent at work. At first, I have a problem with clarifying what topic is important and why. Even if I choose one, I have a difficulty with defining milestones or steps to proceed. In effect, I feel like I am not doing anything important or valuable for anyone. I don't see any work progress, nor outcomes I would like to achieve. Everything looks to me as a total mess. No goal. No strategy. No value. Frustration. Anger. Mental breakdown.

However, it should be simple to put all the things on the right track. In my opinion the creative work in technology always was like: reading, writing, learning, coding, and adjusting the perspective of what's *the next big thing* (at least for myself od my company).

### Today's implementation work
