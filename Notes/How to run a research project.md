# How to run a research project

## Background

It appears that running a research project is not that easy task as one would expect. It's easy to start and explore whatever we found interesting at the moment. However, it's hard to manage the progress, outputs and outcomes.

## Where do I start?

In my case, a research project starts with a more or less clear problem statement or an article (a set of articles).

When the ignition point is a problem statement I try to produce more questions and some early answers (or would rather say hypothesis). It often leads to jumping into implementation, and often as well, appears to be dead end and some research and reading has to take place.

When it comes to articles - I might got interested just by the title - I usually read it twice. The first go is a reconnaissance - I try to capture the general idea, assess my understanding of the topic and the article, optionally reject the article. The second run is more deliberate - I try to understand what I read, the concepts, theory, and the connections between them.

After double reading, it's the time to check what I did understood so far, so I write down a summary or describe the main idea to someone else. If I stuck in the middle, it's a signal that I need to get back to the text once again, maybe just for re-reading the problematic part.

Once, I build confidence that I have some understanding of the article, topic or concept, I decide what to do next:
- Should I build a prototype? A complete one or just part of it?
- Should I build a simulation or do analysis to see if I can repeat the premised results?
- Should I search for related articles and study them first?
- Should I stop the project?

## Prototyping

## Examples

Example problem statement: Could we build an ML solution only on synthetic data - not being exactly the same in structure or distribution as the real data - and still be capable to use this solution in a real project?
