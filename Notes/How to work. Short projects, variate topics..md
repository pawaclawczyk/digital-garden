# How to work. Short projects, variate topics.

## Rules

1. Reduce number of open projects. In the best case it should be only one project.
2. Reduce time required to complete the project to 2-4 weeks. Change project scope if it cannot be completed within this period.
3. Once project is completed start next one. It can be related to a different topic.
4. Keep track of all other projects, ideas and requests.
