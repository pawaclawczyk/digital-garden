# Dagster - Research Journal

- Thursday 2022-05-12 18:15:59 
	- #tags-here
	- I have already overview of ops and jobs, IO managers, and root input managers.
	- Now I'm going to learn
		- how to deploy Dagster on Kubernetes?
		- how to manage multiple Dagster's repositories (e.g. from different projects) with one Dagster deployment?
		- how to run ops as Kubernetes jobs?
		- Is it possible to run graph embedded in other graph, but with different executors, e.g. the sub-graph is run in a single process, but the main graph is run in multiple processes?
