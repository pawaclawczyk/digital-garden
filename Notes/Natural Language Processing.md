# Natural Language Processing
## Tasks
- [[Keyword Extraction]]
- [[Topic Modeling]]
## Resources
- [awesome-nlp](https://github.com/keon/awesome-nlp)

### Thoughts

- What practical use cases do you see?
	- Twitter keyword analysis?
	- Confluence documents keyword analysis?
	- Blog posts keyword analysis? (I.e. I don't have enough time to read everything, but it could be somehow indexed by keywords and content quality for later read.)
