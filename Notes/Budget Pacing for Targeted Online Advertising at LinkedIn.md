# Budget Pacing for Targeted Online Advertising at LinkedIn

## Methodology

1. Read the paper
2. Write a summary of the core idea
3. Implement a simulation and prototypical ad server with ASAP and throttled pacing technique.

## Worth consideration

- How will the algorithm behave if we use artificial forecast, i.e. uniform distribution?

	- I'm starting the research journal. I will mention some of the earlier decisions, but won't recreate all of them.
	- As the presented pacing algorithm strongly depends on the forecast of the impressions, it might be interesting to see what happens when there is no forecast, i.e. there is artificial forecast of uniform distribution.
