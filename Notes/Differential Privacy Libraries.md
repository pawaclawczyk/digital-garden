# [[Differential Privacy]] Libraries

- [Google's differential-privacy](https://github.com/google/differential-privacy) building blocks library provides low-level implementations for C++, Go and Java
- [OpenMined's PyDB](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDP) is a Python library build on top of Google's differential privacy building blocks
- [OpenMined's PipelineDB](https://github.com/OpenMined/PipelineDP/) is a Python framework for applying differential privacy using batch data processing systems such as Apache Spark, Apache Beam, or use framework-free API, it's build using PyDP but provides higher level API and integrations
- [Facebook's Opacus](https://github.com/pytorch/opacus) is a library for PyTorch enabling training models with differential privacy
- [Google's TensorFlow Privacy](https://github.com/tensorflow/privacy) is a library enabling differential privacy for training models
