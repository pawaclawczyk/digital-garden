## Content
## Introduction: How Strategy Really Works

It's about strategic approach used in P&G. FMCG sector.

Strategy as a discipline. Prior being a part of management discipline.

Strategy is about choices.

> strategy is an integrated set of choices that uniquely positions the firm in its industry so as to create sustainable advantage and superior value relative to the competition

Strategy focuses on building long-term competitive advantage.

Ineffective approaches to strategy:
1. define strategy as a vision - too high
2. define strategy as a plan - too low
3. deny that long-term (or even medium-term) strategy is possible - referring to dynamically changing business environment
4. define strategy as the optimization of the status quo - does not change activities only optimize them, wrong activities may be optimized, new (not ordinary, not known before) challenges are not being able to overcome using the already applied methods methods
5. define strategy as following best practices - copy of the industry practices leads to mediocracy

The issue is reluctance to make really hard choices.

### Chapter One: Strategy Is Choice

Story of "Oil of Olay", and expansion in the skin-care market. They've re-created the brand, to compete with luxury products while having competitive price. The price was set slightly beyond mass-market, but below the luxury one. They sacrifice low-income customers in order to attract the medium and high-income ones. They leverage the way how people translate the price to the quality of product.

The story is told in way to fit the presented framework (the backbone of the book).

1. What are the aspirations?
2. Where to play?
3. How to win?
4. What capabilities are required?
5. What management systems are required?

Strategic choices are the winning choices. Chose what you *do* and what you *don't*.

Building a strategy is an iterative process. All questions have to be answered.

### Chapter Two: What Is Winning

Mentioned [[../Notes/Peter Drucker]] -- The purpose of an organization is to create a customer.

It's about winning, not just playing (participating in the game).

The statement is supported with the story of GM Saturn which tried to be part of small and cheap cars market. It competed with Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, which wanted to win in this market. The THN investments were to be the best in the market, where GM investments where just to keep the manufacturing alive (probably, they're not so innovative as competitors). Maybe THN knew the market better, so they could make better choices?

P&G outsourced GBS (global business services) to the best-of-breed BPOs (business process outsourcer). They choose to outsource utilities, and focus on core services. They choose to divide PBS (IT services, buildings management, employee services) and outsource each to "the best" BPO in a space. The best one was chosen against criterion that the cooperation must benefit P&G as well as the BPO. It was no longer about cost reductions by outsourcing GPS, but also about creating competitive advantage for the future.

Aspirations need to be set outward, not inward. Focus on customers and market, not the products. Example: smartphone business versus helping people to connect anytime and anywhere; the latter can be provided by a smartphone or something else. Win with the customers (what does winning mean to your customer?).

Seek for the best competitors, no matter whether they're smaller or larger than you. Ask yourself what strategically or operationally they do better than you.

Aspirations are not strategy.

>A strategy is a coordinated and integrated set of where-to-play, how-to-win, core capability, and management system choices that uniquely meet a consumer’s needs, thereby creating competitive advantage and superior value for a business. Strategy is a way to win—and nothing less.

### Chapter Three: Where To Play

The base story is about Bounty brand - a paper towel.

The choices made was reverting from targeting global audience and focus on local North America (geography), focus on the upper half of customers (not become a commodity brand), recognizing and targeting three kinds of customers in the upper half of the market (be introducing three products).

The "where" choice was about geography and customers segment.

The Bounty brand was part of family-care division. On the division level another choices were made. They stoped pursuing for creating new, promising products, and focused on a product (paper towels) they had well established market share and quality of the product itself.

### Chapter Four: How To Win

The background story. P&G attempts to introduce orange juice to the market. It had technology (calcium absorption) advantage, but the market was owned by two large players - Coke and Tropicana (later acquired by PepsiCo). It failed the competition, to the degree that it wasn't able to sell the brand later. It was forced to license the technology to the two major players.

The main story. P&G had competitive technology, but the market (plastic bags) was already ruled by large players (similar conditions as in the case of orange juice). This time P&G started looking for a third option beside play-and-lose or licensing out the technology. It started a joint venture with one of the current competitors, giving out the technology, full control over the business and product, and taking only 10% of shares (later 20%). Over the years the business multiplied the initial value.

P&G redefined who "winning" means. The previous approach was to become the market undisputed leader with its own brand. This time P&G didn't enter market directly, instead they take a part in the success of other company's brand.

There are two kinds of winning strategies producing sustainable competitive advantage.
1. Low-cost strategies. The technology, scale, operational systems allows you to produce the same quality product or service at lower cost than competitors. You may need to sacrifice nonconforming customers.
2. Differentiation strategies. Your product or service is more valuable to the customers than products or services of the competitors. You can sell it for higher price, while having the costs on the same level as competitors. You must think of every aspect of your product or service. You need to satisfy the individual customer needs and expectations.

In the both cases, you are able to have a larger margin than competitors. An obvious advantage is capability to undervalue your product (set lower prices). However the main advantage is in having higher margin than competitors (same price is hold) and being capable to make larger investments. You can invest in wide range of activities from marketing to technology. E.g., Mars (candy bar business) invested in better spots in stores (where the product is placed around a store, visibility of the product in a store) where their products were located and available to customers.

"Where to play" and "how to win" are dependent on each other and should always be considered together.

### Chapter Five: Play to Your Strengths

>the five capabilities core to P&G’s where-to-play and how-to-win choices are consumer understanding, brand building, innovation, go-to-market ability, and global scale

The main story. Acquisition of Gillette. Gillette was around 1/3 of the size and capabilities of P&G. It was not usual acquisition, when success company acquires unsuccessful one. It required integration of the frontline - customers, products, research, and leadership - as the backend - operations, systems, and infrastructure. P&G assumed that Gillette has similar strategy as their own, so it is a good fit and the cost is worth it. They expected further growth of the brand in the future.

Side story. Scientists went to India to learn how potential local customers are "shaving every day", then they designed new blade from scratch. The design had to fit the real needs that could be only observed on that new market (no access to flowing hot water).

The organizations core capabilities (activities) are those which make strategy successful. These are reinforcement forces in the organization systems. Various core capabilities must fit together to deliver competitive advantage. Neither one in separation can do that.

[[Michael Porter]]

Exercise.
1. What are the core capabilities of an organization?
	1. They should be rather organization level than business level. If they're business level then they apply to other organizations as well, and don't create any distinctive capability.
2. Which are essential?
	1. Which create real and measurable competitive advantage today?
		1. Do they have potential to grow in the future?
	2. Which are relevant and import to majority of organization's activities?
	3. Which make a real distinction between winning and losing?
3. (System of activities) What activities supports the core capabilities?
	1. Do the activities create reinforcing relations?
4. What is the defensibility of the structure?
	1. Are there competitors having the same capabilities?
	2. Can competitors with similar capabilities imitate yours "where to play" and "how to win"?
		1. Is the activity system easy to copy?
		2. Is it required to copy the whole system in order to win?

Activity system qualities: feasibility (doable), distinctiveness, defensibility.

Reverse engineer your competitors system to learn what are the common items and focus on the distinctive ones.

Reinforcing rods. The capability and activity maps differs between levels in an organization. A rod represents a connection between these levels. The costs and efforts are aggregated on higher levels where are optimized (e.g., a common research lab for two or more brands). An aggregation introduces non-negligible cost which would not occur if the subsidiaries were independent companies. It may lead to closing some of the branches (products or services) when the capabilities and activities cannot be utilized in a larger scope.

### Chapter Six: Manage What Matters

[[Chris Argyris]]

P&G adjusted the strategy review meetings to be more focused on discussion related to the strategic questions, rather than long slide-deck presentations and queries for budget acceptance. The discussion was about "where to play" and "how to win" rather than random ideas, performance or people. It improved individual and team strategic thinking capabilities.

The questions to be discussed were delivered to everyone before the meeting, so everyone was able to prepare.

The approach had to be balanced between advocacy of one's own ideas and inquiry towards other ideas. The goal was to discuss and understand one's point of view rather than convince everyone in the room to one's own perspective. The dialog was important.

P&G adapted the OGSM (objectives, goals, strategy, measurements) framework to focus around the questions of "where to play" and "how to win" being core of the S part.

The strategy must be clearly communicated to everyone in the organization. Not only pushed down as formal document through the next levels of managers.

P&G's example of communicating the global strategy company-wide.

>1.  Make the consumer the boss.
>2.  Win the consumer value equation.
>3.  Win the two most important moments of truth.

The strategy points explained:
1. Treat consumer as the key stakeholder.
2. Create products for every segment of customers - same brand, complementary product categories at different prices.
3. Confirm the product premise (advertisement) on the first contact with the customer (on store shelf) and on second one - the first use.

[[Clayton Christensen]]

Build systems to support capabilities.

Examples:
- invest new consumer research methodologies,
- invest in understanding the innovation process,
- formalized brand building framework,
- invest in strategic partnership with retailers,
- invest in scope and scale,
- creation of global category managers,
- consolidating purchases globally.

>what gets measured gets done

>If aspirations are to be achieved, capabilities developed, and management systems created, progress needs to be measured.

Measurements provide focus and feedback.

Measurement must define in advance what are the expected outcomes. It must clearly define ranges of success or not. Humans tend to rationalize any outcome of a measurement. It must be specific.

A success is multidimensional (customers, financial, internal), so must be the measurements of the success.

P&G switch from market TSR (total share revenue) to operating TSR.
The operating measures mixed the sales growth, profit margin improvement, and increase in capital efficiency; integrated revenue growth, margin growth, and cash productivity.

Create custom metrics, weighting various qualities of a product or service. See if they're able to explain the current market leader position.

### Chapter Seven: Think Through Strategy

Start with a prototype strategy. Improve it in iterations. Answer all five questions.

Tools (SWOT, BCG growth matrix, GE-McKinsey nine-box matrix, VRIN model) are helpful but the outcome is un-focused and doesn't cover the whole landscape of strategy.

Authors propose *strategic logic flow* framework to support making decisions on "where to play" and how to win". The framework enforces analysis of the following dimensions:
1. the industry (segmentation and structure),
2. the customer values (channels and end consumer),
3. the relative position (capabilities and costs),
4. the competition.

Defining industry attractiveness with [[Michael Porter]] five-forces analysis.

- Central: rivalry amongst existing competitors
- Horizontal axis: bargaining power of suppliers, bargaining power of buyers - which entities capture the industry values - producers, suppliers, or buyers?
- Vertical axis: threat of new entrants, threat of substitute products or services - what's the value of industry? for how many parties is the value split? how difficult is it to enter the business?

Channels should be analyze when there is intermediary unit between the producer and end consumer (e.g., in the P&G case the retailers). Otherwise it can be omitted.

Understand your customers in qualitative, not quantitative way. Seek closely for what do they care. Consumer surveys just scratch the surface of the real needs.

Don't assume that competitors will be doing the same they're doing today. Will the strategy survive when competition changes their course? If they copy your moves?

Organization strategy building must be a collaborative process. It needs to bring different points and ideas to the table. The communication, decisions and actions need to be done together.

### Chapter Eight: Shorten Your Odds

Reverse engineering strategic options

1. Frame the choice (narrow down to two mutually exclusive choices)
2. Generate strategic possibilities (what success stories can hide behind the choices, generate as many as possible, it's an inclusive stage)
3. Specify conditions (what would have to be true for given possibility to happen, don't argue about possibility, lay out the logic required for it, distinguish nice-to-have and must-have conditions, the latter eliminate the possibility, use the logic flow framework)
4. Identify barriers to choice (skeptic assessment of the conditions, which of them are likely to hold true, why some conditions won't not be true, the undecidable or less likely to be true conditions are the barier conditions - remember that they're already the must have ones)
5. Design valid tests (design tests for barier conditions, the conditions looks for me like hypothesis, and a good hypothesis is falsifiable)
6. Conduct tests (start with the most unlikely barier condition, test one at a time, make the test "inch wide and mile deep" - it means very focused and to the detail, instead of wide but shallow)
7. Choose (not much to do)

### Appendix B: The Microeconomic Foundations of Strategy and the Two Ways to Win

The two ways of winning - by low costs or by differentiation - are explained on the ground of demand-supply theory. The demand is defined as aggregation of specific demand curves of all consumers on the market. The supply is bound the costs, especially the costs varying with the quantity of produced goods.

Competition in the commodity market strongly follows the demand-supply behavior and the price is dictated by the market. New entrants usually copy the best competitors and improve a little bit, so the variable cost get lower and price may be decreased. Such situation can push the competitors with high costs out of the market. Which further decrease the available quantity of the product and price can rise.

On a unique (product or service) market, the producer is rather price-setter than price-taker. The profit is based on optimizing price and quantity, finding the sweat-spot between the cases where the demand is too low and where the price is too low. Companies on this market take care of every customer as the demand is reduced by the profit optimizations.

## Commentary

The book relates to FMCG corporate business with many divisions, brands and products. The presented patterns and insights may not apply directly to small companies or start-ups with a single product and limited scale.

However, the backbone of strategic thinking and questions to ask still apply to small organizations.

Having a little background on strategy discipline, organization management, and systems thinking, might be helpful while reading this book.

My prior knowledge of strategy as a discipline comes from [[Good Strategy / Bad Strategy]]. I didn't found any strictly contradictory points between them. This book shares some tools and frameworks helping to craft a strategy. Also, [[Systems Thinking: A Primer]]) was helpful to understand the topic of capabilities and activities system, and reinforcing relations.
