## Details

### Chapter One: Strategy Is Choice

Story of "Oil of Olay", and expansion in the skin-care market. They've re-created the brand, to compete with luxury products while having competitive price. The price was set slightly beyond mass-market, but below the luxury one. They sacrifice low-income customers in order to attract the medium and high-income ones. They leverage the way how people translate the price to the quality of product.

The story is told in way to fit the presented framework (the backbone of the book).

1. What are the aspirations?
2. Where to play?
3. How to win?
4. What capabilities are required?
5. What management systems are required?

Strategic choices are the winning choices. Chose what you *do* and what you *don't*.

Building a strategy is an iterative process. All questions have to be answered.

### Chapter Two: What Is Winning

Mentioned [[../Notes/Peter Drucker]] -- The purpose of an organization is to create a customer.

It's about winning, not just playing (participating in the game).

The statement is supported with the story of GM Saturn which tried to be part of small and cheap cars market. It competed with Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, which wanted to win in this market. The THN investments were to be the best in the market, where GM investments where just to keep the manufacturing alive (probably, they're not so innovative as competitors). Maybe THN knew the market better, so they could make better choices?

P&G outsourced GBS (global business services) to the best-of-breed BPOs (business process outsourcer). They choose to outsource utilities, and focus on core services. They choose to divide PBS (IT services, buildings management, employee services) and outsource each to "the best" BPO in a space. The best one was chosen against criterion that the cooperation must benefit P&G as well as the BPO. It was no longer about cost reductions by outsourcing GPS, but also about creating competitive advantage for the future.

Aspirations need to be set outward, not inward. Focus on customers and market, not the products. Example: smartphone business versus helping people to connect anytime and anywhere; the latter can be provided by a smartphone or something else. Win with the customers (what does winning mean to your customer?).

Seek for the best competitors, no matter whether they're smaller or larger than you. Ask yourself what strategically or operationally they do better than you.

Aspirations are not strategy.

>A strategy is a coordinated and integrated set of where-to-play, how-to-win, core capability, and management system choices that uniquely meet a consumer’s needs, thereby creating competitive advantage and superior value for a business. Strategy is a way to win—and nothing less.

### Chapter Three: Where To Play

The base story is about Bounty brand - a paper towel.

The choices made was reverting from targeting global audience and focus on local North America (geography), focus on the upper half of customers (not become a commodity brand), recognizing and targeting three kinds of customers in the upper half of the market (be introducing three products).

The "where" choice was about geography and customers segment.

The Bounty brand was part of family-care division. On the division level another choices were made. They stoped pursuing for creating new, promising products, and focused on a product (paper towels) they had well established market share and quality of the product itself.

### Chapter Four: How To Win

The background story. P&G attempts to introduce orange juice to the market. It had technology (calcium absorption) advantage, but the market was owned by two large players - Coke and Tropicana (later acquired by PepsiCo). It failed the competition, to the degree that it wasn't able to sell the brand later. It was forced to license the technology to the two major players.

The main story. P&G had competitive technology, but the market (plastic bags) was already ruled by large players (similar conditions as in the case of orange juice). This time P&G started looking for a third option beside play-and-lose or licensing out the technology. It started a joint venture with one of the current competitors, giving out the technology, full control over the business and product, and taking only 10% of shares (later 20%). Over the years the business multiplied the initial value.

There are two kinds of winning strategies producing sustainable competitive advantage.
1. Low-cost strategies. The technology, scale, operational systems allows you to produce the same quality product or service at lower cost than competitors. You may need to sacrifice nonconforming customers.
2. Differentiation strategies. Your product or service is more valuable to the customers than products or services of the competitors. You can sell it for higher price, while having the costs on the same level as competitors. You must think of every aspect of your product or service. You need to satisfy the individual customer needs and expectations.

In the both cases, you are able to have a larger margin than competitors. An obvious advantage is capability to undervalue your product (set lower prices). However the main advantage is in having higher margin than competitors (same price is hold) and being capable to make larger investments. You can invest in wide range of activities from marketing to technology. E.g., Mars (candy bar business) invested in better spots in stores (where the product is placed around a store, visibility of the product in a store) where their products were located and available to customers.

"Where to play" and "how to win" are dependent on each other and should always be considered together.

### Chapter Five: Play to Your Strengths

>the five capabilities core to P&G’s where-to-play and how-to-win choices are consumer understanding, brand building, innovation, go-to-market ability, and global scale

The main story. Acquisition of Gillette. Gillette was around 1/3 of the size and capabilities of P&G. It was not usual acquisition, when success company acquires unsuccessful one. It required integration of the frontline - customers, products, research, and leadership - as the backend - operations, systems, and infrastructure. P&G assumed that Gillette has similar strategy as their own, so it is a good fit and the cost is worth it. They expected further growth of the brand in the future.

Side story. Scientists went to India to learn how potential local customers are "shaving every day", then they designed new blade from scratch. The design had to fit the real needs that could be only observed on that new market (no access to flowing hot water).

The organizations core capabilities (activities) are those which make strategy successful. These are reinforcement forces in the organization systems. Various core capabilities must fit together to deliver competitive advantage. Neither one in separation can do that.

## Embedding in Context

After reading the "Good Strategy/Bad Strategy", I would classify these steps as follows.

1. Diagnosis:
	1. What are the aspirations?
	2. Where to play? (researching and understanding of options and past experiences)
	3. How to win? (researching and understanding of options and past experiences)
2. Guiding policy
	1. Where to play?
	2. How to win?
3. Supporting policies and coherent actions
	1. What capabilities are required?
	2. What management systems are required?
