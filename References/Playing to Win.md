# Playing to Win

## Chapter One: Strategy Is Choice

Story of "Oil of Olay", and expansion in the skin-care market. They've re-created the brand, to compete with luxury products while having competitive price. The price was set slightly beyond mass-market, but below the luxury one. They sacrifice low-income customers in order to attract the medium and high-income ones. They leverage the way how people translate the price to the quality of product.

The story is told in way to fit the presented framework (the backbone of the book).

1. What are the aspirations?
2. Where to play?
3. How to win?
4. What capabilities are required?
5. What management systems are required?

After reading the "Good Strategy/Bad Strategy", I would classify these steps as follows.

1. Diagnosis:
	1. What are the aspirations?
	2. Where to play?
2. Guiding policy
	1. How to win?
3. Supporting policies and coherent actions
	1. What capabilities are required?
	2. What management systems are required?

Strategic choices are the winning choices. Chose what you *do* and what you *don't*.

Building a strategy is an iterative process. All questions have to be answered.

## Chapter Two: What Is Winning

Mentioned [[../Notes/Peter Drucker]] -- The purpose of an organization is to create a customer.

It's about winning, not just playing (participating in the game).

The statement is supported with the story of GM Saturn which tried to be part of small and cheap cars market. It competed with Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, which wanted to win in this market. The THN investments were to be the best in the market, where GM investments where just to keep the manufacturing alive (probably, they're not so innovative as competitors). Maybe THN knew the market better, so they could make better choices?
