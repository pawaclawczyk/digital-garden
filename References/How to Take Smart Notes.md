## Content

### Introduction

The available literature focus on the topic on writing "big works", such as books, essays, articles; it discusses the style, structure and forms.

Note taking is a mundane activity without a feedback loop (no one is saying that the note taking style or organization is bad), so there is no explicit need for literature.

When starting work on writing a larger piece a common issue is the "blank screen", everything is in the head of an author and it's hard to put it down in an organized form. The process of starting and writing is often related to motivation and will power of an author.

Will powers is a very limited resource and it's mainly dependent on an environment, not on ourselves. The key to success is not *having will power*, but *not having to use it*.

The proposed solution is to have a system for note taking and organizing them, so they can seed the bigger work and an author avoids the "blank screen" problem.

### Chapter 1: Everything You Need to Know

Clear structure of the workflow (system) eliminates the need of will power; it's obvious what to do.

A system allows to drop one topic and jump to another, then later easily get back.

Workflow vs Plan

A note taking workflow does not enforce having a plan.
In general, having a plan does not suit to open-ended work as research or studying. However, not having a plan does not exactly mean to have a mess.
An expert learns in a way that generates insights, accumulate knowledge and sparks new ideas, so it often cannot be planned at all.

There are two mindsets, of an expert (researcher) and planner.
